Tails, The Amnesic Incognito Live System, version 1.3, is out.

This release fixes [numerous security issues](https://tails.boum.org/security/Numerous_security_holes_in_1.2.3/) and all users must [upgrade](https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/upgrade/) as soon as possible.

New features
------------

-   **[Electrum](https://tails.boum.org/doc/anonymous_internet/electrum/)** is an easy to use bitcoin wallet. You can use the [**Bitcoin Client** persistence feature](https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/persistence/configure/#electrum) to store your *Electrum* configuration and wallet.

-   The **Tor Browser** has additional operating system and data **security**. This security restricts reads and writes to a limited number of folders. [Learn how to manipulate files](https://tails.boum.org/doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser/#confinement) with the new *Tor Browser*.

-   The **obfs4 pluggable transport** is now available to connect to Tor bridges. Pluggable transports transform the Tor traffic between the client and the bridge to help disguise Tor traffic from censors.

-   **[Keyringer](https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/keyringer/)** lets you manage and share secrets using *OpenPGP* and *Git* from the command line.

Upgrades and changes
--------------------

-   The **Mac and Linux manual installation** processes no longer require the `isohybrid` command. Removing the `isohybrid` command simplifies the installation.
-   The **tap-to-click** and **two-finger scrolling** trackpad settings are now enabled by default. This should be more intuitive for Mac users.
-   The **Ibus Vietnamese input method** is now supported.
-   **Improved support for OpenPGP smartcards** through the installation of *GnuPG* 2.

There are numerous other changes that may not be apparent in the daily operation of a typical user. Technical details of all the changes are listed in the [Changelog](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/tails/plain/debian/changelog).
