Tor 0.2.6.4-rc fixes an issue in the directory code that an attacker might be able to use in order to crash certain Tor directories. It also resolves some minor issues left over from, or introduced in, Tor 0.2.6.3-alpha or earlier.

If no serious issues are found in this release, the next 0.2.6 release will make 0.2.6 the officially stable branch of Tor.

You can download the source from the usual place on the website. Packages should be up in a few days.

**NOTE:** This is an alpha release. Please expect bugs.

Changes in version 0.2.6.4-rc - 2015-03-09

-   Major bugfixes (crash, OSX, security):
    -   Fix a remote denial-of-service opportunity caused by a bug in OSX's \_strlcat\_chk() function. Fixes bug 15205; bug first appeared in OSX 10.9.
-   Major bugfixes (relay, stability, possible security):
    -   Fix a bug that could lead to a relay crashing with an assertion failure if a buffer of exactly the wrong layout is passed to buf\_pullup() at exactly the wrong time. Fixes bug 15083; bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha. Patch from "cypherpunks".
    -   Do not assert if the 'data' pointer on a buffer is advanced to the very end of the buffer; log a BUG message instead. Only assert if it is past that point. Fixes bug 15083; bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha.
